# Pomodoro Timer

A gentle, non-intrusive Pomodoro Timer designed for people who want break reminders without being forced to stop working. Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for simplicity and reliability.

## Why This Timer?

Perfect for developers, writers, and anyone in deep focus states who needs reminders but not interruptions.
